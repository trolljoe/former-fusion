# Astro is pretty cool

i've been using astro for the past uh, day, but i already kinda love it. i know i didn't really make this website, but it's so customizable, and much easier than [sveltekit](https://kit.svelte.dev/). it's great for static/simple websites, and even i that don't have much knowledge on it, picked up on it pretty quickly after just reading the **docs** even as a total dumbass that doesn't know anything

anyways, go try [astro](https://astro.new/latest) out!
